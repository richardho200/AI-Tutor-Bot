Capstone Research Project-Advised by Dr. Leilani Gilpin University of California, Santa Cruz(Winter 2024-Spring 2024 Quarter)

Winter 2024 Program: APIRequest.py Python file

There are 2 models been examined in the OpenAI's API versions during the experiment of examining these 5 sample questions during the Winter 2024 quarter: "gpt-3.5-turbo" and "gpt-4-turbo-preview"

How to run this file:
There are five CSE 240 questions in the context of every user's role because we are asking the OpenAI's API to evaluate their answers. 

For instance question 1 is commented for reference on using respective question on conducting mutiple trials in my experiment,
#Question 1
{"role": "user", "content": "When is DFS better than BFS search?"}

In order to run this program with accurate results, comment all of the unused questions first. Then begin running the program to have 
accurate results. After using one question(Question 1) for experiment, uncomment Question 2 user and assistant role to begin the the trial
of API models.

If you using Question 2 to experiment the API, Comment all questions which are commented below to have the best performance 
Comment the system role to make program make different answers than original chatGPT answers uncommenting this will have same answers as ChatGPT answers
